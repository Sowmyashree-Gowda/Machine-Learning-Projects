## Project Description

Story veracity detection is crucial in various applications, such as identifying fake news, detecting fraudulent claims, and evaluating online reviews. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish deceptive stories from truthful ones.

Key objectives:
- Build and preprocess a dataset of labeled stories.
- Extract meaningful features from the text.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Visualize and interpret the results to improve transparency.

---

## Features

- **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization:** Data distributions, performance metrics, and confusion matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project includes:
- Stories labeled as true or deceptive.
- Preprocessed text for feature extraction.

### Sources:
- Publicly available datasets.
- Synthetic data for balanced distribution.
